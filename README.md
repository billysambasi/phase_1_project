# Phase_1_Project

Description of the Project

The project focuses on enabling the company's entry into the  aviation industry by analyzing data to identify aircraft that pose the lowest operational and safety risks. The goal is to provide data-driven insights into aircraft models, incident rates and failure points including environmental factors such as weather conditions and locations. By assessing historical safety records, incidents and trends in failure types, this analysis creates comprehensive risk profiles for various aircraft. The findings aim to guide the aviation division in selecting aircraft that are not only safe but also operationally reliable, minimizing risks and maximizing efficiency in the new venture. 

In addition, the project will explore how aircraft perform under diverse operational environments, factoring in weather conditions to evaluate resilience and adaptability. By investigating correlation between aircraft quality including make, model, engine type and number of engines and their safety, it uncovers key indicators for selecting durable and dependable aircraft. The project then translates analytical results to actionable recommendations that align with the company's strategic goals ensuring a successful and informed expansion into aviation.
